# Backend Scripts

This directory contains utility and seeding scripts for the Team Evaluatie App backend.

## Seeding Scripts

### seed_peer_evaluations.py

**Purpose:** Seeds peer evaluations with scores, feedback, and reflections for specified students.

**What it creates:**
- Multiple peer evaluations (draft, open, and closed status)
- Allocations (reviewer -> reviewee pairs) including self-assessments
- Scores with optional feedback comments for each rubric criterion
- Reflections for students (for closed evaluations)

**Target data:**
- School ID: 1
- Course ID: 1
- Student IDs: 5, 6, 7, 8, 18, 19, 20, 34, 35, 36, 37

**Prerequisites:**
1. School with ID 1 must exist
2. Course with ID 1 must exist
3. Students with the specified IDs must exist and be enrolled in school 1
4. At least one peer rubric must exist for school 1

**Usage:**
```bash
cd backend
python scripts/seed_peer_evaluations.py
```

**What it does:**
1. Validates that school, course, and students exist
2. Finds available peer rubrics for the school
3. Creates 3 peer evaluations:
   - Q1 evaluation (closed)
   - Q2 evaluation (closed)
   - Q3 evaluation (open/current)
4. For each evaluation:
   - Creates self-assessment allocations (each student reviews themselves)
   - Creates peer review allocations (each student reviews 2-3 others randomly)
   - Generates realistic scores (1-5 scale) with appropriate distribution
   - Adds optional feedback comments (60% probability)
   - Creates reflections for closed evaluations

**Score distributions:**
- Self-assessments: tend to be slightly higher (mostly 3-5)
- Peer assessments: more varied (1-5 with realistic distribution)
- Feedback quality varies based on score level (positive, neutral, constructive)

**Note:** If an evaluation with the same name already exists, it will be deleted and recreated.
