# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation that is no longer actively maintained but preserved for reference purposes.

## Purpose

The archive serves several purposes:

1. **Historical Context**: Preserves decision-making processes and implementation details from past development phases
2. **Reference Material**: Provides context for understanding the evolution of the codebase
3. **Incident Reports**: Maintains security incident records and post-mortems for learning purposes
4. **Implementation Notes**: Contains detailed notes from feature implementations that are now complete

## Contents

### Security Incident Documentation
Historical security incident reports, investigations, and remediation summaries from 2024-2026. These documents provide valuable lessons learned but are no longer current operational guides.

### Implementation Summaries
Feature implementation notes and summaries from completed development phases. These describe how features were built but are superseded by the current architecture documentation.

### Migration & Fix Documentation
Historical migration plans, test plans, and fix summaries for completed work. Useful for understanding past decisions but not needed for current development.

### CSRF Protection Documentation
Historical documentation of CSRF protection implementation. Superseded by current security documentation in the main docs.

### Deprecated Guides
Outdated guides and quick-starts that have been replaced by current documentation.
