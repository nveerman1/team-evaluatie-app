# minimatch bundled inside npm's own node_modules (not our application code).
# All npm@11.x versions ship minimatch@^10.1.1 with internal lockfile pinned to 10.1.2.
# No npm release ships minimatch@>=10.2.1 yet. npm is a package manager and is not
# invoked at runtime by the Next.js production server. Our app's own minimatch is 10.2.2.
